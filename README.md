# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

## Important note: 

one major warning I would like to say is about the screen optimization, clearly optimal screen to view the project would be a screen of 15.6inch laptop.

another thing I would like to explain about the mobile view I have also not worked on it as I mailed the team and asked them they said that it would be a great if I add the mobile view too but it was late a little bit and I have created major portion of the project.

Finally I would like to bring your view over the css work I used tailwind css.

You may also see any lint errors in the console.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
